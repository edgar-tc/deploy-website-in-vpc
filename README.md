ðŸ”¹ VPC Setup: Configured 2 public and 2 private subnets with dedicated route tables and internet gateways. 

ðŸ”¹ Auto Scaling: Established an Auto Scaling Group to ensure high availability with dynamically managed EC2 instances. 

ðŸ”¹ Bastion Host: Implemented a bastion instance for secure SSH access to private subnets. 

ðŸ”¹ Security: Utilized SCP for secure file transfers and ensured private instances were not directly accessible from the internet. 

ðŸ”¹ Load Balancing: Deployed an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic evenly across servers. 

ðŸ”¹ Deployment: Hosted my website using Pythonâ€™s HTTP server, making it externally visible.

I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to, Abhishek Veeramalla for his invaluable support and guidance throughout this project.

This project provided an excellent opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical, real-world scenario. I look forward to tackling more such challenges in the future! ðŸ’»ðŸŒŸ
